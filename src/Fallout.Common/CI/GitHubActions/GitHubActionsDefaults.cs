/// The marketplace actions the workflow generator emits, and the versions it pins them to — the single
/// place to bump one. Override any of them per workflow via
/// <see cref="GitHubActionsAttribute.CheckoutAction"/>, <see cref="GitHubActionsAttribute.CacheAction"/>,
/// <see cref="GitHubActionsAttribute.SetupDotNetAction"/>, and
/// <see cref="GitHubActionsAttribute.UploadArtifactAction"/>, so a newer action release never has to wait
/// on a Fallout release.

/// Deliberately internal: those properties take a plain string, so nothing a consumer writes needs to name
/// this type. Keeping it out of the public surface also keeps it out of the <c>Nuke.*</c> transition shims,
