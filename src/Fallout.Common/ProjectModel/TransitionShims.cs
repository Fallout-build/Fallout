// canonical `Fallout.Solutions.*` instances, so intermediate variables typed
// against `Fallout.Common.ProjectModel` will not bind, and `GenerateProjects`
// source-generation keys off the canonical attribute type and won't fire through
// the shim. `fallout-migrate` (or the Nuke→Fallout codefix) is the complete
// migration path — it rewrites every reference, shallow and deep. This mirrors the
// same ceiling the generated `Nuke.Common.ProjectModel` transition shim has.
