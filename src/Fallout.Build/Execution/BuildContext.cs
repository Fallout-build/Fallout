/// Per-run, process-ambient build state. Activated once at the top of <see cref="BuildManager.Execute{T}"/>
/// and disposed at the end of the run, so the process-global statics a build touches are owned by a
/// scope rather than leaking across invocations (the cleanup FT-1 centralised now lives here).
/// The static surface (e.g. <see cref="BuildManager.CancellationHandler"/>) reads through
/// <see cref="Current"/>, which is <c>AsyncLocal</c> — so concurrent runs each resolve their own
/// context. That isolates the ambient pointer and the per-run state hanging off it (the cancellation
/// handlers, the event subscriptions), <em>not</em> the process-global singletons the teardown resets
/// (in-memory sink, value-injection cache, tool-path resolver config); those stay shared, so
/// concurrent runs in one process still interfere through them.
