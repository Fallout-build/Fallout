    /// reassigns Serilog's <c>Log.Logger</c> on every call. Called with no build, it installs a
    /// pipeline with no file sinks, no host sink and no filter. A second container calling this
    /// method would then wipe out the pipeline the first one had set up.

    /// <see cref="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Information"/> — qualified because the
    /// unqualified name binds to Fallout's own <see cref="LogLevel"/> from the enclosing namespace.
