// Three generated workflows. build.yml and build-cross-platform.yml both run Test+Pack; all
// three are GENERATED from the attributes below — edit here and regenerate (`./build.sh`),
// never hand-edit the `.yml`.
//
//   build.yml               — the Linux PR gate, and the ONLY required status
//                             check (job `ubuntu-latest`; branch protection keys on
//                             that job name, not the workflow file/name). PR-only:
//                             feature-branch pushes run zero CI until a PR is opened
//                             against a long-lived branch (#327), targeting develop,
//                             main, release/*, or support/*. CheckoutRef = github.head_ref
//                             pins checkout to the PR source branch instead of the
//                             merge SHA, keeping HEAD attached so
//                             GitHubTasksTest.GitHubRepositoryFromLocalDirectoryTest
//                             (which reads .git/HEAD via GitRepository.FromLocalDirectory)
//                             resolves a non-null branch. Also runs PackageGuard — its
//                             policy-violation check gates every PR, though the target skips
//                             SBOM/risk-report generation here (build/Build.PackageGuard.cs,
//                             IsOnLongLivedBranch — this checkout is never on one of the four).
//                             EnableGitHubToken avoids anonymous GitHub API rate-limiting on
//                             PackageGuard's license lookups, now that it runs on every PR.
//
//   build-cross-platform.yml — macOS + Windows in ONE workflow (one job per image).
//                             Cross-platform full Test+Pack is gated to RELEASE
//                             INTENT (#318/#326): it runs only on a PR into a
//                             production branch (main, release/*, support/*) and on
//                             a release tag push (v*) — never on routine pushes/PRs to
//                             develop. On develop "we've got our edge": the
//                             ubuntu-latest gate above + the preview pipeline
//                             (.github/workflows/publish-packages-preview.yml).
//                             (workflow_dispatch as a manual cross-platform trigger
//                             isn't emitted — the generator only writes
//                             workflow_dispatch when it has inputs; GitHub's built-in
//                             run re-run covers the on-demand case.)
//
// concurrency cancel-in-progress (#322): superseded runs are cancelled rather than
// stacked. Never applied to the publish-packages-release workflow (a publish must
// not be cancelled).
