# @fallout/graph-control (PoC)

Fallout-branded build/run graph control. Not a GitHub clone — its own dark,
radioactive-amber identity, built to become the run-graph control for the VS
Code extension, the `--plan` HTML report, and eventually the Fallout CI platform.

**Stack:** [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) (layered layout) +
[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) (`@xyflow/react`, interaction/pan/zoom).
Layout and render are deliberately separate layers — the layout is
surface-independent, the renderer is swappable.

## Run it

```bash
cd poc/graph-control
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server, hot reload — opens the demo fixture
npm run build      # → dist/index.html, a single self-contained file you can double-click
npm run build:lib  # → dist-lib/fallout-graph-control.js, an IIFE for host embedding
npm run report     # → dist-lib/report.html, a self-contained static build-graph report
```

## Static HTML report

`npm run report [build-graph.json] [out.html]` emits one self-contained HTML file
(the control's IIFE and the graph JSON inlined) — double-clickable, offline, no
server. This is the shape the `fallout` `--plan` HTML report will take. With no
graph path a small sample is used.

**Dark by default** (`data-theme="dark"` is pinned), with a toggle that remembers
the viewer's choice in `localStorage` — a shared report stays dark regardless of
the viewer's OS, but can be flipped to light. In the VS Code webview the control
instead follows the editor theme (no pin), and no toggle is shown.

## Embedding in a host (webview / HTML report)

`build:lib` emits one self-contained IIFE (React + React Flow + elkjs bundled,
CSS injected at runtime) exposing a global. Load it as a single `<script>` and:

```js
FalloutGraph.mount(document.getElementById('graph'), buildGraph, {
    onRunTarget: (name) => { /* host decides what "run" means */ },
});
```

Re-calling `mount` on the same element reconciles in place — that's how the VS
Code extension does its live refresh. The runtime `<style>` injection needs
`style-src 'unsafe-inline'` in the host's CSP.

## How it maps to Fallout

- Data model mirrors `build-graph.json` (see `src/model.ts` ↔
  `poc/vscode-fallout/src/model.ts` and `SerializeBuildGraphAttribute.cs`).
- Edge semantics match the Mermaid/`--plan` output: solid = `dependsOn`,
  dashed = `after`, thick = `triggers`.
- A host injects a real graph via `window.__FALLOUT_GRAPH__`; otherwise the
  bundled demo fixture renders.
- `status` on a target (`queued`/`running`/`succeeded`/`failed`/`skipped`) is
  **reserved for the live/CI phase** and absent from schema v1.

## Phases

1. **This PoC** — layout + brand look, static, standalone HTML. ✅
2. Wire into the VS Code extension (replace Mermaid) + emit the static HTML report.
3. Live: `BuildManager` streams per-target status → the control animates the run.
